                <h3>How to Pack Fragile Items</h3>
                <p>Use high-quality packing materials like bubble wrap, packing paper, and sturdy boxes. Wrap each fragile item individually and fill empty spaces in boxes with cushioning materials to prevent shifting. Clearly label boxes as "Fragile" and ensure they are securely taped.</p>

                <h3>Moving to Canberra: A Guide</h3>
                <p>Canberra offers a relaxed lifestyle with excellent amenities. Research suburbs like Belconnen for family-friendly areas or Braddon for a vibrant city vibe. Plan your move during off-peak seasons to save costs and avoid traffic congestion.</p>

                <h3>Decluttering Before Your Move</h3>
                <p>Sort your belongings into four categories: keep, donate, sell, or discard. Decluttering reduces moving costs and makes unpacking easier. Donate usable items to local charities in Canberra or Sydney, and sell valuable items online to offset moving expenses.</p>
